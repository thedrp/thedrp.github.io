#### March 3, 2020
Basic navigation has been added to the top of the site. The homepage, news archive, and the new Resource hub can now be accessed from anywhere on the site via the left side of the navbar. Most useful things this site has to offer can be found through the Resource hub.

Additionally, on the right of the navbar is an about page with contact info and more.

The navbar will continue to grow as new collections of pages are added.

In closing, most pages on the site will begin to have a string of categories along the bottom. These categories link to a list of pages which share those categories. This also means that every page with a link to any specific category page will in turn be linked to within said category page.

Note: Various images may be tagged as "missing" for a while after writing this, and some links will take a while to get working again. This is not an error. Many pages and assets have been moved since 2017, but everything will be in order soon enough.
