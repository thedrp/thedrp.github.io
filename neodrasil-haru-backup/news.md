Basic navigation has been added to the top of the site. The homepage, news archive, and the new Digimon category page can now be accessed from anywhere on the site via the left side of the navbar.

Additionally, on the right of the navbar is an about page (under construction at the time of writting this) and a List of Categories page which should serve as a sort of master browsing function for the site. Every page on the site should be accessible by following down the rabbit hole of links strating from the List of Categories page.

The navbar will continue to grow as new collections of pages are added.

In closing, every page on the site, currently and moving forward, should have a string of categories along the bottom. These categories link to a list of pages which share those categories. This also means that every page with a link to any specific category page will in turn be linked to within said category page.

Note: Various images will be tagged as "missing" for a while after writting this. This is not an error. The images have not been uploaded yet, but should be in the coming few days.

I've begun adding multiple Character and Digimon pages to the wiki, filling them with basic and structural information. So far these pages barely link to one another, but once I've put more of them together I'll be working back through them to make sure that they do. The goal currently is still building templates and really nailing down the look and flow of the wiki.

These new pages will be available from the homepage here, through various branches of other more comprehensive pages, in the near future. For now, they are online, but you'll need to navigate to them directly via URL.

I will continue working through these types of wiki pages, as well as compiling the more comprehensive pages that will be linked to from here on the homepage.

For a very early look at these sorts of pages, check out [Aero](/wiki/digimon/Biyomon_(Robert)).

This site is brand new and is constantly being worked on. While itâ€™s still so new, it will largely be unusable, until there are multiple pages created, completed, and connected. Check back here to keep up with any major updates as we go.
