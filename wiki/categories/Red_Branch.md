### Pages only belong to the Red Branch category if they are focused on something that did not exist during the Common Branch or have changed dramatically since then.

**Examples of pages that belong to the Red Branch category:**

*[Heather's Floramon](../digimon/Floramon_(Heather)) didn't exist until after the Common Branch.*

*[Neo's Gumdramon, "Moon"](../digimon/Gumdramon_(Neo)), did exist during the Common Branch, but served a very different role and has since gained an entirely different evolution line.*

**Examples of pages that do *not* belong to the Red Branch category:**

*[Robert's Greymon, "Grey"](../digimon/Greymon_(Robert)), has gained new forms and continued to be relevant since the Common Branch, but has remained fundamentally the same.*
