I've begun adding multiple Character and Digimon pages to the wiki, filling them with basic and structural information. So far these pages barely link to one another, but once I've put more of them together I'll be working back through them to make sure that they do. The goal currently is still building templates and really nailing down the look and flow of the wiki.

These new pages will be available from the homepage here, through various branches of other more comprehensive pages, in the near future. For now, they are online, but you'll need to navigate to them directly via URL.

I will continue working through these types of wiki pages, as well as compiling the more comprehensive pages that will be linked to from here on the homepage.

For a very early look at these sorts of pages, check out [Aero](/wiki/digimon/Biyomon_(Robert)).

This site is brand new and is constantly being worked on. While itâ€™s still so new, it will largely be unusable, until there are multiple pages created, completed, and connected. Check back here to keep up with any major updates as we go.
