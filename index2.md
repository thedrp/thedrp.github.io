This landing page, as well as the rest of the site, is still very new and under heavy construction. Please bear with us.

Basic navigation has been added to the top of the site. The homepage, news archive, and the new Digimon category page can now be accessed from anywhere on the site via the left side of the navbar.

Additionally, on the right of the navbar is an about page (under construction at the time of writting this) and a List of Categories page which should serve as a sort of master browsing function for the site. Every page on the site should be accessible by following down the rabbit hole of links strating from the List of Categories page.

The navbar will continue to grow as new collections of pages are added.

In closing, every page on the site, currently and moving forward, should have a string of categories along the bottom. These categories link to a list of pages which share those categories. This also means that every page with a link to any specific category page will in turn be linked to within said category page.

Note: Various images will be tagged as "missing" for a while after writting this. This is not an error. The images have not been uploaded yet, but should be in the coming few days.
